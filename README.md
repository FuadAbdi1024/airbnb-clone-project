- It **reduces user frustration** and drop-off rates
- Builds **trust and credibility**, especially during payment
- Ensures **smooth navigation**, even for non-tech-savvy users
- Encourages repeat visits by offering a satisfying experience
- Makes accessibility possible for a wider range of users

### üõ†Ô∏è Importance of Identifying Design Properties

Identifying and documenting design properties such as color styles and typography in mockup designs is crucial for several reasons:

- **Consistency:** Ensures a unified look and feel across all pages and components.
- **Communication:** Provides clear guidelines for developers, designers, and stakeholders to understand the design intent.
- **Efficiency:** Speeds up development by having predefined styles ready to implement.
- **Quality:** Helps maintain visual hierarchy, readability, and accessibility.
- **Collaboration:** Tools like Figma allow design specs (colors, fonts, spacing) to be shared precisely, reducing ambiguity during handoffs.

These design specifications act as the blueprint for translating visual mockups into functioning user interfaces with pixel-perfect accuracy.
